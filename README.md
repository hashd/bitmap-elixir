Bitmap
======

In computing, a bitmap is a mapping from some domain (for example, a range of integers) to bits, that is, values which are zero or one. It is also called a bit array or bitmap index.

This is an Elixir implementation of a bit array using binaries.

It is a fast space efficient data structure for lookups.
